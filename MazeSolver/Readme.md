The project deals with finding the shortest path in a given maze by mentioning start points and end points from the mouse dynamically on the maze.
The input image is given as "Input_Maze_Image.jpg".
We have used morphological operations such as erosion, dilation, skeletization for creating the thin image for maze solving which is given by "Thinned_Maze_Image.jpg".
After applying the A-star algorithm, the output of the image is given as "Output_Shortest_Path_Image.png".
The model gives accurate output for input maze.
